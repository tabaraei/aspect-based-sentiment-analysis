\abstract{This paper presents an approach to aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) using the \texttt{BornClassifier}, comparing its performance with NLTK and RoBERTa large language models. The methodology involves sentiment classification, feature extraction, and aspect detection for sentiment-related text. We utilize the \texttt{SemEval2014Dataset} and \texttt{AmazonReviewsDataset}, analyzing their effectiveness through experiments. Results demonstrate that the \texttt{BornClassifier} outperforms both NLTK and RoBERTa in ABSA tasks. We also discuss potential future improvements, including the incorporation of specialized datasets and overcoming the problem of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens.}
